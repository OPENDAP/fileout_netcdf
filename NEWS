Version 0.9.2 (08 April 2009)

Many new capabilities. The handler does not process Sequences, but it can
process a response that contains them - an attribute will be added that
indicates that a sequence was found and left out (elided) from the netCDF
file.

Among the many new tweaks, the resulting file contains names compatible with
netCDF 3.6.2.

Version 0.9.0

It's brand new. Still to do: Seqences. This contains no explicit support CF,
although that's slated for a future version.
