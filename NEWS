Version 1.0.0 (02 February 2010)

This release is a bug fix release, with memory leaks cleaned up, fortify
security issues resolved, and shared dimensions cleaned up.

From the TODO list below:
1.  FONc.Tempdir=/tmp parameter added to the fileout_netcdf configuration. And the filename used for the temporary file is randomly generated.
2. debug statements added using the BESDebug method, using the context
fonc. For debugging fileout_netcdf, use -d "bes.dbg,fonc"
3. Correct exceptions generated and returned to the client as with any
of the other modules.
4. Writing of attributes is done as part of creating the variables,
instead of a separate pass, as was done before.
5. bes-testsuite created to use besstandalone application for running
and testing fileout_netcdf capabilities. Also added unit tests.

Still left TODO:
1. Handling of sequence data
2. Further cleanup of shared dimensions.

Version 0.9.3 (09 June 2009)

Fix for ticket 1300 - some Grids from HDF4 files were not represented
correctly. This is an important update because the handler was returning
incorrect data values and variable sizes.

Version 0.9.2 (08 April 2009)

Many new capabilities. The handler does not process Sequences, but it can
process a response that contains them - an attribute will be added that
indicates that a sequence was found and left out (elided) from the netCDF
file.

Among the many new tweaks, the resulting file contains names compatible with
netCDF 3.6.2.

Version 0.9.0

It's brand new. Still to do: Seqences. This contains no explicit support CF,
although that's slated for a future version.

TODO:
- Need to be able to configure where the temporary netcdf file is stored and
  generate a uniq name for the file as it is possible for multiple requests
  of this type to be handled at the same time by different processes.
- Add debug statements using BESDEBUG and the debug context of fonc
- Change any error conditions from simply printing to cerr to throwing an
  exception. Please refer to the different exception types.
- Look into how attributes are written to the file. I believe that it
  requires the container.attributes section of the define statement.
- Create a testsuite that is stand alone, not requiring any other modules
  except the dap modules.
- Need to be able to write out Grid data.
