This directory holds programs that build .dods files that are 
used along with the dapreader hadnler to test the fileout_netcdf 
handler's operation. The programs were copied from the original
'unit-tests' directory (which may have been removed by now...)
and modified to just make .dods files that the dapreader handler
can process.

Over time the tests in 'unit-tests' got stale because they never
tested the netcdf4 output and used a cloned version of the fileout_netcdf
handler's main 'transform()' function - they were not actually testing
the handler. As teh handler was modified more and more, the cloned
transform() and the hadnler's code diverged. The tests in 'tests'
use the handler itself.

Some of the programs are here but are not used:

attrT is redundant (fnoc1 and other tests have attributes) and has
broken output for an unknown reason - something in the BESDapResponseBuilder
code that write teh DAS.

seqT seems pointless since this handler just ignores sequences

readT does what dapreader does, but as an executable

The programs are built automatically, but they have to be run 
by hand - the data files are stored in the data directory.
