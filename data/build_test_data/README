This directory holds programs that build .dods files that are 
used along with the dapreader hadnler to test the fileout_netcdf 
handler's operation. The programs were copied from the original
'unit-tests' directory (whcih may have been removed by now...)
and modified to just make .dods files that the dapreader handler
can process.

Some of the programs are here but are not used:

attrT is redundant and makes for broken output
seqT is pointless since this handler just ignores sequences
readT seems really odd

The programs are built automatically, but they have to be run 
by hand - the data files are stored in the data directory.
